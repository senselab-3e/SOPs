# About

Basic node + express server setup for rendering pages. Route created for each SOP page - simple portal links each of them. Many many png, gif files to populate inbetween spaces, under public/assets/ --- > 

# Setup

- run npm install 
- create .gitignore file with:
node_modules/
.gitignore
package-lock.json
.DS_Store

- run nodemon express_server.js // 

*there is also a rudimentary server with routes set up with basic node as well (via App.js) just for practice, but more was build up with express.server.js, in node express.
